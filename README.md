# face-detection-using-computer-vision
This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV and a Haar cascade classifier. It is part of my internship at Pantech AI. The script uses a webcam to detect faces and draws rectangles around them. Features: Python, OpenCV, Haar Cascade. Run `face_detection.py` to see it in action.
